📈 Stock Market Prediction with LSTM

Predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks in Python.

🔍 Overview

This project uses LSTM, a deep learning technique for time-series analysis, to forecast stock prices based on historical data. It incorporates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

🚀 Features

✅ Data Collection & Preprocessing (Normalization, Scaling) ✅ LSTM Neural Network for time-series forecasting ✅ Visualization of Predictions vs Actual Prices ✅ Optimization techniques (learning rate decay, batch size tuning) ✅ Performance Metrics (Loss, MSE, RMSE)
